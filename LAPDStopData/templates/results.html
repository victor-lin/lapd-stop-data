  <h1 class="center">Our Observations</h1>
  <p class="center" style="font-size: 18px"> The main goal of our project is to give an informative yet unbiased view of police stops in the Los Angeles metropolitan area to serve as a sample for the entire United States. The charts provided an easy way to see an understand some of the major questions asked about police/civilian interactions in modern day society. Some of our main queries, such as the distribution of race amongst location and the distribution of stops amongst locations can be further analyzed to see if there were any hidden intentions or prejudice behind a police stop. Our website aims to be a factual and informative basis for such analysis.
