  <h2 class="center">Our Observations</h1>
  <p class="center" style="font-size: 18px"> The main goal of our project is to give an informative yet unbiased view of police stops in the Los Angeles metropolitan area to serve as a sample for the entire United States. The charts provided an easy way to see an understand some of the major questions asked about police/civilian interactions in modern day society. Some of our main queries, such as the distribution of race amongst location and the distribution of stops amongst locations can be further analyzed to see if there were any hidden intentions or prejudice behind a police stop. Our website aims to be a factual and informative basis for such analysis.

<h3>
Distribution of Stops Amongst Location </h3>
<p>

From the pie chart figure, it is evident that the top 5 locations with the most stops in LA in 2015 are Valley Traffic, West Traffic, Central, South Traffic, and Hollywood. The total stops in these 5 locations alone sum to 167,516. Out of the 26 locations in the data set, the top 5 have 36% of stops in LA. This analysis is useful in understanding that more stops take place in Valley Traffic, West Traffic, Central, South Traffic, and Hollywood than the other locations.
</p>
<h3>
Distribution of Race Amongst Locations</h3>
<p>
There are a total of 279,574 Hispanics stopped, 161,105 black people stopped, 161,105 white people stopped, 19,861 Asians stopped, and 36,154 other ethnicities stopped. From the total distribution we can assess the specific ethnicity percentage for each area according to chart. For Valley Traffic, the district location accounts for 9% of all Asians stopped, 8% of Hispanics stopped, 12% of White people stops, 2% of black people stopped, and 15% of other ethnicities stopped. If we had other demographic data, for each division location a better analysis of ethnicity distribution for traffic stops can be obtained.

<h3>
Reasons for Police Stops</h3>
<p>
Out of 464,471 police stops, 75% of stops were from vehicle stops and 25% were from pedestrian stops. This information can be used to illustrate how pedestrian rules are enforced in LA and can be broken down into locations to emphasize locations with more traffic and hence pedestrian precautions.</p>
